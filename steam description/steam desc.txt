"The year is 1936 and within the first week of this new year, news is spreading across the Soviet Union. Stalin has "disappeared" and Leon Trotsky has returned to power. Will Leon Trotsky help fuel the World Revolution? Will the United States protect the world from the spread of Communism? Will the Germans fend off the socialist reformers? And will Japan succeed in the Pacific?"
